		<h3>About Encryption...</h3>
		<p>Encryption is the process of translating information into an alternate format,
		with the purpose of making the information unattainable to those unauthorised to
		access the information. Some of the earliest uses of encryption dates back to around
		600 BC when the Ancient Spartans attempted to gain an advantage during warfare by
		sending war tactics using a device capable of communicating written messages. Both
		the sender and receiver of the device had joint knowledge of how to operate the device
		which allowed the messages to be translated only by the intended receiver. Today we
		rely on encryption for many things from the privacy of our online shopping details to
		bank records and phone passwords.
